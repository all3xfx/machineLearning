#machine learning web app:

* `gestures.html`:  the "structure" of the presentation of the web page.
* `gestures.js`:  the "brains" of the web page. Tries to detect a mouse gesture when the mouse runs over the "pad".

You can try out the web app and see my sample code here: [https://codepen.io/hchiam/pen/rrwQRa](https://codepen.io/hchiam/pen/rrwQRa).

The underlying neural network works something like a simplfied time delay neural network [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_delay_neural_network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_delay_neural_network)
