# machineLearning
Simple test code for machine learning.

* `neuralNet1.py`:  version 1 example of a very simplified neural network, using **sensitivity** parameter.
* `neuralNet2.py`:  version 2 example of a very simplified neural network, with **weighting** based on "responsibilities" of different **inputs**.
* `neuralNet3.py`:  version 3 example of a very simplified neural network that **combines** version 1 and version 2, combining sensitivity parameter and "responsibilities" of different inputs.
* `neuralNet_iamtrask.py`:  2-layer neural net code from: http://iamtrask.github.io/2015/07/12/basic-python-network.  Requires NumPy installed to run.
